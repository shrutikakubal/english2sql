English to SQL converter powered by EvaDB

This project aims to provide an AI powered model that will generate SQL statements based on the user’s requests in natural language.

The project connects to EvaDB and the Postgres database, where it extracts and stores the schema of each table. This schema includes column names, data types, lengths, and other characteristics like nullable/non-nullable, autogenerated fields, etc. The schema information is stored in the 'SUMMARY' table.
The 'SUMMARY' table serves as context for the AI model (gpt-3.5turbo) to answer questions accurately. We use EvaDB's CHATGPT function to ask questions, using custom prompts tailored for each type of query.
Users can provide either the exact table name or ask for the most relevant one. If the table name is provided, its schema is used as context for the AI model. If not, the tool finds the most relevant match in the 'SUMMARY' table and generates SQL statements accordingly.
The project utilizes the Marvin library. Marvin is an AI-powered classifier that employs logit bias to return classifications.

•	The user can ask questions which are classified as select/insert/update or other questions.

• The user can provide the exact table name for faster and more accurate responses.

• In case of a SELECT, the user is asked if they want to execute the statement. In the prompt, we ask the LLM to wrap the SQL statement in ```sql<statement>```. If the user wishes to execute, the statement is automatically parsed from the model’s output and executed by EvaDB.

•	After each response the user is asked if they want to ask another question. Once they answer ‘no’, the session ends.
